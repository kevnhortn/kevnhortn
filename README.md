### Hi, I'm Kevin Horton. :v:

I'm a front-end developer, writer, and teller of honest stories based in North Carolina. I specialize in HTML Email Development and Web Development with a keen eye for design. Constantly learning, I enjoy building and designing things that provide value to the world around us.
